# Bright Network Hiring Challenge

## Overview

At Bright Network, matching graduates with their ideal first jobs and employers with their ideal graduate intake is core to what we do. This technical challenge is designed to give you a flavour of what it might be like to work for us and for us to assess the kind of developer you are and the skills and approach to problem-solving you're bringing to the table.

## The Challenge

In one of our suggested programming languages, please implement a very simple recommendations algorithm to match members to their perfect job.

The code needs to fetch the required data from the following APIs:

<https://bn-hiring-challenge.fly.dev/members.json>

<https://bn-hiring-challenge.fly.dev/jobs.json>

For each member, please print their name and their recommended job(s).

We'd like you to spend less than 2 hours on the problem, so your solution will not be perfect (and that's absolutely fine). The purpose is to let us see some of your code, and to give us something to discuss in the technical interview.

Please work in a git repository, and share the repository with us via either a link or zip file. Please also include a README which explains the choices you made and the limitations of your approach.

N.B. at Bright Network, you'd be working on apps with hundreds, if not thousands, of modules. We've had some very clever submissions in the past that were essentially (one-file) scripts. This doesn't really show us enough of your coding abilities to make an assessment - we're not instructing you to write code for the sake of it, but if in doubt, be slightly more expansive with your solution.
